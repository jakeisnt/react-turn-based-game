#+TITLE: Build a React Turn-Based Game!

This sets out to be a complete starter kit for building React and Node.js turn-based games.

* (Desired) Features?
- Create and join rooms
- See all players within your current room
- Pass the turn to the next player in the room
- Reset room after game is finished
* Development
This is a standard full stack JavaScript app build with `yarn` and organized with yarn workspaces.
Frontend and backend are found in `packages/client` and `packages/server`, respectively.

** Start developing:
1. Make sure you have an `eslint` plugin installed for your editor of choice.
2. Run `yarn install` in the root directory to install all dependencies. Do not run it in the `client` or `server` directories - this is a bit annoying to clean up.
3. Run `yarn start` in the root directory to start up the hot reloading process.

* Technologies
** Front-end
- [[React][https://reactjs.org/]] functional components for templating and structure. Industry standard.
- [[XState][https://xstate.js.org/]] for state management, local and global. This is excellent for game development.
- CSS-in-JS [[(JSS)][https://cssinjs.org/?v=v10.6.0]]: This is my personal preference, but it's not something we have to use.
** Backend
- [[Express API][http://expressjs.com/]] with [[websocket extensions][https://github.com/HenningM/express-ws]]. I think it's best to use websockets and in-memory data as much as we can, because there isn't much of a reason to create accounts and persist data yet (IMO).
** Ops
- All-in-one, strongly opinionated ESLint + Prettier linting and fixing. Feel free to convert errors into warnings if something is annoying you.
- Some sort of deployment infrastructure
- Nix infrastructure (as needed)
